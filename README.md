## MORINGA SCHOOL PHASE 1 WEEK 1 CODING CHALLENGE ##

1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
+ This week's coding challenge presented three different coding assignments that were described as follows on the Canvas webpage:

#CHALLENGE 1# This challenge expected a program that prompted the user to input student marks. The input should have been between 0 and 100 and outputted a grade based on set criteria.

#CHALLENGE 2# This challenge expected a program that accepted the speed of a car and if the speed was less than 70, an “Ok” message would be returned. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it would have given the driver one demerit point and printed the total number of demerit points.

#CHALLENGE 3# This challenge expected a program whose major task was to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits.

2. PROJECT SETUP
+ The project has been divided into 6 files that have been grouped into two depending on the challenge. These two files include the .html files and the .js file.

+ To run the .js file, one must access its adjacent .html to open its webpage on the browser. Each .js file contains well explained comments that are useful in navigating the code in the files.

+ The following is a guide to accessing the project's content:
    #1. CHALLENGE 1 = project1.html, project1.js
    #2. CHALLENGE 2 = project2.html, project2.js
    #3. CHALLENGE 3 = project3.html, project3.js

3. AUTHOR AND LICENSE
+ This project was fully and wholly designed, coded, implemented and tested by Alex Njagi and was completed on Sunday, 19th March, 2023.
